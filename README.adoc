= CV

== Objective

Build or lead a software team working on Linux to embrace change, provide
timely delivery, avoid waste and with minimal issues from production.


== Highlights

- Languages: Go, C, C++, Java, Python, Scala
- Scripting: Bash, Ansible, AWK
- Databases: Redis, ClickHouse
- Message Queue: Kafka
- Tools: Git, Docker, Prometheus, Make, CMake, Hadoop
- Linux system calls and kernel configuration

== What can I do?

- Construct command-line based software for Unix-like (e.g. CentOS, FreeBSD)
  operating systems. 
- Debug and resolve issues on Linux (tcpdump, dstat, strace).
- Design applications for high availability, scalability, manageability, and
  extensibility.
- Improve team output via system-wide solutions. Work closely with the Dev
  manager to manage scope, date and work breakdown.
- Communicate effectively in English.
- Guide multiple engineers on low-level design using design patterns. Develop
  similar competent engineers over 1-2 years.
- Maintain neat Git history through rebasing, commit splicing and avoiding
  merge commits.

== Achievements

Some real life achievements:

- Self learnt Go and introduced it in the team. Go is a unique language that
  gives fast development as well as runs quickly. Its avoidance of common
  sources of slowness like build-time and run-time dependency management has a
  direct impact on the business. Ultimately, we brought it to good use,
  writing over 20,000 lines of code (measured using
  https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc[cloc]). (2019-)
- Fully defined performance measurement procedure (sar, pidstat) and metrics
  (e.g. records processed per second per core) that was used across a dozen
  applications.
- Introduced the use of Bash scripts (aka `run-tests.sh`) to do a basic
  integration checks. (2020)
- Traffic interception using iptables (2019)
- Log capture (sysdump, plugins)
- Decision to write application logs to Kafka in a textual format (JSON).
  Reading from Kafka and writing to a database that was the initial choice did
  not work because it could not give the desired throughput. Switching to
  ClickHouse was fast because the applications did not have to change. (2021)
- Fully defined and implemented the release process from single command build
  to RPM creation following https://semver.org/[semantic versioning]
  guidelines.
- Maintainer of more than 20 Git repos in the company.
- Nearly https://stackoverflow.com/users/3636464/pdp[4000] rating in Stack
  Overflow. Top 9% in 2022.

== Who am I?

- Strong understanding of Unix philosophy (e.g. writing tools that do one
  thing well, improving functionality by making one tool take the output of
  another).
- Like documentation using a lightweight markup language like
  https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc].
- Love technology and working with brilliant people
- Believe that great work gets done by making small improvements. A holistic
  approach to efficiency is key. All team members have to focus on technology,
  process and people.
- Post graduate in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Roorkee.
- Continuously employed since the last 17 years. Regularly on retention
  bonuses.
