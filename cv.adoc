= CV

== Objective

Build or lead a software team working on Linux to embrace change, provide timely
delivery, avoid waste and with minimal issues from production.

== Highlights

- Languages: Go, Bash, C, C++, Java, Python, Scala, Make, AWK
- Tools: Redis, Kafka, Git, Dockers, Prometheus, Ansible, Hadoop
- Linux system calls and configuration

== What can I do?

- Construct command-line based software for Unix-like (e.g. CentOS, FreeBSD)
  operating systems. 
- Debug and resolve issues on Linux (tcpdump, dstat, strace)
- Design applications for high availability, scalability, manageability and
  extensibility
- Improve team output via system-wide solutions. Work closely with the Dev
  manager to manage scope, date, work breakdown.
- Communicate effectively in written English
- Guide multiple engineers on low-level design using design patterns. Develop
  similar competent engineers over 1-2 years.
- Maintain neat Git history through rebasing, commit splicing and avoiding
  merge commits.

== Achievements

Some real life achievements:

- Self learnt Go and introduced it in the team. Go is a unique language that
  gives fast development as well as runs quickly. Its avoidance of common
  sources of slowness like build-time and run-time dependency management has a
  direct impact on the business. Ultimately, we brought it to good use,
  writing over 20,000 lines of code (measured using
  https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc[cloc]). (2019-)
- Fully defined performance measurement procedure that was used across a dozen
  applications.
- Introduced the use of Bash scripts (aka `run-tests.sh`) to do a basic
  integration checks. (2020)
- Traffic interception using iptables (2019)
- Log capture (sysdump, plugins)
- Writing GSX and GIM to Kafka (JSON). This was done by extending logging.
  (2021).
- Fully defined and implemented the release process from single command build
  to RPM creation following https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] guidelines.
- Maintainer of more than 20 Git repos in the company.

== Who am I?

- Strong understanding of Unix philosophy (e.g. writing tools that do one
  thing well, improving functionality by making one tool take the output of
  another).
- Like documentation using a lightweight markup language like
  https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc].
- Love technology and working with brilliant people
- Believe that great work gets done by making small improvements
- Post graduate in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Roorkee.
- Continuously employed since the last 17 years. Regularly on retention
  bonuses.
